## :clipboard:Introduction 

Our system is designed to help users **quickly find rooms, houses, or commercial spaces** that best match their criteria.
The websiteâ€™s key advantage is its **recommendation system**, which broadens users' options and shortens the time required to find a suitable accommodation.
Additionally, users can search based on the **map** we provide. All listings are strictly vetted by us before being made public to other users.
The system features several notable functions:
including displaying the **location of the accommodation** and **nearby amenities on the map**, 
**notification functionality for new posts** , the ability to **save favorite listings**, 
and showing the total number of **likes** for a listing or the aggregate likes across all of a user's listings. **Email verification** for users is also included.
**For administrators**, there is functionality to **manage all users** and their **posts**.
All listings must be **approved by the admin**, which helps minimize risks for users when searching for accommodation.
